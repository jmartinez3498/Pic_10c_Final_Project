# Pic_10c_Final_Project

# 5/19/2020
Starting programming project. Reading up on what qt is.
Reading tutorial on QT https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Beginners
Downloaded qt, decided to go for open source version

# 5/26/2020 Update
Well I finally figure out how to set up qt with version control and create an actual README. 
I just followed what other people in the Pic 10c groupchat did to set up qt. Although I kept 
getting an error when trying to push my commits to github which I figured out was caused because
of the option to create a README through github itself. I followed https://techoverflow.net/2017/08/09/how-to-solve-git-fatal-no-configured-push-destination/
and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37937984/git-refusing-to-merge-unrelated-histories-on-rebase
to fix the problem
